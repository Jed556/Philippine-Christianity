        <h2>Religion in the Philippines</h2>
        <p>
            By the time the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, Islam was firmly established on Mindanao and Sulu.
            During American rule in the first half of this century the Muslims were never totally pacified during the
            so-called "Moro Wars". According to new research (Norman, n.d.), since independence, particularly in the
            last decade, there has been resistance by large segments of the Muslim population to national integration.
            Christianity combines the surface veneer of Christian monotheism and dogma with indigenous animism. It may
            manifest itself in farmers seeking religious blessings on the irrice seed before planting or in the
            placement of a bamboo cross at the comer of a rice field.
            <br>
            The Iglesia ni Cristo, begun around 1914 and founded by Felix Manolo Ysagun, was once about 20 percent of
            the Filipino population. Today they have declined to about 5 percent and are associated with the Protestant
            Episcopal Church of the United States. There has also been a proliferation of Rizalist sects, claiming the
            martyred hero of Philippine nationalism, Jose B. Rizal as the second son of God and an incarnation of
            Christ.

        <h2>Christian History of the Philippines</h2>
        <p>
            The Spice Islands were a small group of islands to the northeast of Indonesia and the southeast of the
            Philippines.In research from Niles (2021), they were known for being the largest producers of nutmeg, clove,
            mace, and pepper in the world. The Portuguese and Spanish saw their global explorations primarily as
            commercial ventures. But they also saw a religious calling for their trans-oceanic journeys. In 1515,
            Ferdinand Magellan's expedition to the Philippines led by a military captain turned Augustinian monk, Andres
            de Urdaneta, started a Catholic missionary presence in the Philippine islands that would last for three
            centuries.
            <br>
            With very few Catholic settlers or parish priests, the work of evangelizing the locals fell to the
            missionary orders. Manila, the Spanish colonial capital on the island of Luzon, was declared an open city,
            where all Catholic orders could work and serve.

                                With the arrival of Miguel Lopez de Legaspi in 1565, Spain
                                introduced Christianity to the Philippines.
                                Beginning in 1350, Islam began to spread from Indonesia into the Philippine archipelago.
                                According to
                                current data, Islam was well-established on Mindanao and Sulu, with outposts on Cebu and
                                Luzon by the
                                time the Spanish arrived in the 16th century (Norman, n.d.). When the Spaniards arrived,
                                the Muslim
                                parts of the islands had the highest levels of political integration and, given more
                                time, would have
                                most likely united the entire archipelago.

                                After Magellan, the Spanish returned to the Philippine islands. This time, their

                                Andres de Urdaneta, a former military captain who later became an Augustinian monk. When
                                he joined the
                                Spanish fleet in Mexico in 1565, Urdaneta insisted on traveling to the Philippines as a
                                missionary
                                rather than a soldier. According to Niles(2021, October 4), Urdaneta was joined by five
                                other
                                Augustinian monks in beginning a three-century-long Catholic missionary presence in the

                                islands, and quickly earned the reputation of a "protector of the Indians" due to his
